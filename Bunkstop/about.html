                    <p class="first-letter">Bunkstop exists because there is a need for clean, hygienic, air-conditioned, affordable accommodation in our country. We need to show the world that India is adapting to a need that is very much there.</p>

                    <p>We were tired of listening to things like: "Everything is so expensive today and only if you spend big money is when you can derive quality." We as a chain of hostels would like to change that perception, fulfill a need that exists in our country, to help people coming from foreign countries feel at home. 
We believe in the phrase .</p>

                    <p>At Bunkstop our philosophy is that "All good things are not necessarily expensive." Thus, we provide quality at affordable prices.</p>
